Object - Objects have states and behaviors. Example: a dog has states - color, name, breed, as well as behaviors -
wagging, barking, eating. An object is an instance of a class.

Class - A class can be defined as template/blue print that describes the behaviors/states that objects of its type
support.

<h2>Objects in Java</h2>
Let us now look in deep to what are objects. If we consider the real world, we can find many objects around us, Cars,
Dogs, Humans, etc. All these objects have a state and behavior.

If we consider a dog, then its state is - name, breed, color, and the behavior is barking, wagging, running.

If you compare a software object with a real world object, they have very similar characteristics.

Software objects also have a state and behavior. A software object's state is stored in fields and behavior is shown
via methods.

So, in software development, methods operate on the internal state of an object and the object-to-object communication
is done via methods.

<h2>Classes in Java</h2>
A class is a blueprint from which individual objects are created.

                              public class Dog {
                               String breed;
                               int ageC;
                               String color;
                               void barking(){
                               }
                               void hungry(){
                               }
                               void sleeping(){
                                 }
                              }
