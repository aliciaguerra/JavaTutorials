Java provides a number of non-access modifiers to achieve many other functionality.

- The static modifier for creating class methods and variables.
- The final modifier for finalizing the implementations of classes, methods, and variables.
- The abstract modifier for creating abstract classes and methods.
- The synchronized and volatile modifiers, which are used for threads.

<h2>Static Variables</h2>
The static keyword is used to create variables that will exist independently of any instances created for the class.
Only one copy of the static variable exists regardless of the number of instances of the class.

Static variables are also known as class variables. Local variables cannot be declared static.

<h2>Static Methods</h2>
The static keyword is used to create methods that will exist independently of any instances created for the class.

Static methods do not use any instance variables of any object of the class they are enclosed in. Static methods
take all the data from parameters and compute something from those parameters, with no reference variables.

Class variables and methods can be accessed using the class name followed by a dot and the name of the variable or method.

<h2>Example</h2>
The static modifier is used to create class methods and variables, as in the following example:

                            public class InstanceCounter {
                              private static int numInstances = 0;
                              
                            protected static int getCount(){
                             return numInstances;
                             }
                             
                            private static void addInstance(){
                            numInstances++;
                            }
                            
                            InstanceCounter(){
                            InstanceCounter.addInstance();
                            }
                            
                            public static void main(String arguments[]){
                            System.out.println("Starting with" + 
                            InstanceCounter.getCount() + "instances");
                            for(int i=0; i<500; i++){
                            new InstanceCounter();
                            }
                            System.out.println("Created" + InstanceCounter.getCount() + "instances");
                            )
  
  <h2>The Final Variables</h2>      
  A final variable can be explicitly initialized only once. A reference variable declared final can never be reassigned
  to refer to a different object.
  
  However, the data within the object can be changed. So, the state of the object can be changed but not the reference.
  
  With variables, the final modifier often is used with static to make the constant a class variable.
  
                             public class Test {
                              final int value = 10;
                              //The following are examples of declaring constants:
                              public static int BOXWIDTH=6;
                              static final String TITLE="Manager";
                              
                              public void changeValue(){
                              value=12;
                                }
                              }
                              
  A final method cannot be overridden by any subclasses. As mentioned previously, the final modifier prevents a method
  from being modified in a subclass.
  
  The main intention of making a method final would be that the content of the method should not be changed by
  any outsider.
  
  You declare methods using the final modifier in the class declaration:
  
                                 public class Test{
                                  public final void changeName(){
                                     }
                                 }
                                 
  The main purpose of using a class being declared final is to prevent the class from being subclassed. If a class
  is marked as final then no class can inherit any feature from the final class.
  
                                  public final class Test{
                                  }
                                  
  <h2>Abstract Class</h2>
  An abstract class can never be instantiated. If a class is declared as abstract then the sole purpose of the class
  is to be extended.
  
  A class cannot be both abstract and final (since a final class cannot be extended). If a class contains abstract methods,
  then the class should be declared abstract. Otherwise a compiler error will be thrown.
  
  An abstract method may contain both abstract methods as well as normal methods.
  
                                   abstract class Caravan {
                                   private double price;
                                   private String model;
                                   private String year;
                                   public abstract void goFast(); //an abstract method
                                   public abstract void changeColor();
                                     }
                                  }
                                  
 An abstract method is a method declared without any implementation. The methods body (implementation) 
 is provided by the subclass. Abstract methods can never be final or strict.
 
 Any class that extends an abstract class must implement all the abstract methods of the super class
 unless the subclass is also an abstract class.
 
 If a class contains one or more abstract methods then the class must be declared abstract. An abstract 
 class does not need to contain abstract methods.
 
 The abstract method ends with a semicolon.
 
                                     public abstract class Superclass{
                                      abstract void m(); //abstract method
                                      }
                                     class SubClass extends SuperClass {
                                      //implements the abstract method
                                      void m(){
                                        }
                                      }
                                      
  <h2>The Synchronized Keyword</h2>
  The synchronized keyword is used to indicate that a method can be accessed by only one thread at a time. The
  synchronized modifier can be applied with any of the four access level modifiers.
  
                                   public synchronized void showDetails(){
                                   }
                                   
  <h2>The Transient Modifier</h2>
  An instance variable is marked transient to indicate to the JVM to skip the particular variable when serializing 
  the object containing it.
  This modifier is included in the statement that creates the variable, preceding the data type or class of
  the variable.
  
                               public transient int limit=55;//will not persist
                               public int b; //will persist
                               
  <h2>The Volatile Modifier</h2>
  Thd volatile is used to let the JVM know that a thread accessing the variable must always merge its own private copy 
  of the variable with the master copy in memory.
  
  Accessing a volatile variable synchronizes all the cached copied of the variables in the main memory. Volatile can
  Volatile can only be applied to instance variables, which are of type object or private. A volatile object reference
  can be null.
  
                           public class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
                             private volatile boolean active;
                             public void run(){
                             active=true;
                             while(active){
                              }
                            }
                            public void stop(){
                            active=false;
                                }
                            }
                            
  Usually, run() is called in one thread (the one you start using the Runnable), and stop() is called from another
  thread. If in line 1 the cached value of active is used, the loop may not stop when you set active to false in line 2.
  That's when you want to lose volatile.
