Modifiers are keywords that you add to those definitions to change their meanings. 

To use a modifier, you include its keyword in the definition of a class, method, or variable. The modifier proceeds
the rest of the statement.

                                   public class className{
                                   }
                                   private boolean myFlag;
                                   static final double weeks = 9.5;
                                   protected static final int BOXWIDTH = 42;
                                   public static void main(String args[]){
                                   //body of method
                                   }
                                   
  <h2>Access Control Modifiers</h2>   
  Java provides a number of access modifiers to set access levels for classes, variables, methods, and constructors.
  The four access levels are:
  
  - visible to the package, the default. No modifiers are needed. 
  - visible to the class only, private
  - visible to the world (public)
  - visible to the packages and all subclasses (protected)
  
 <h2>Non Access Modifiers</h2>
Java provides a number of non-access modifiers to achieve many other functionality.

- the static modifier for creating class instances and variables
- the final modifier for finalizing the implementations of classes, methods, and variables 
- the abstract modifier for creating abstract classes and methods
- the synchronized and volatile modifiers, which are used for threads
