<h2>Inner Classes</h2>
In Java, just like methods, variables of a class can have another class as its member. Writing a class within another
is allowed in Java. The class written within is called the nested class, and the class that holds the inner class is the outer
class. 

<h2>Syntax</h2>
The syntax to write  anested class is given below. Here Outer_Demo is the outer class and Inner_Demo is the nested inner
class.

                 class OuterDemo(){
                    class Inner_Demo(){
                              }
                 }
                 
Nested classes are divided into two types:

- Non-static nested classes: These are the non-static methods of the class.
- Static nested classes: These are the static methods of the class.
