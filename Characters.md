Normally, when we work with characters, we use primitive data types char. 

                             char c='a';
                             //Unicode for uppercase Greek omega character
                             char uniChar='\u039A';
                             //an array of characters
                             char[] charArray = {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'};
                             
However, in development, we come across situations where we need to use objects instead of primitive data types.
In order to achieve this, Java provides a wrapper class Character for the primtiive data type char.
