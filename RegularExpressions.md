Java provides the java.util.regex package for pattern matching with regular expressions. Java regular expressions are
very similar to the Perl programming language and very easy to learn. 

A regular expression is a sequence of characters that helps you match or find other strings or sets of strings, using 
a specialized syntax held in a pattern. They can be used to search, edit, or manipulate text and data. 

The java.util.regex package primarily consists of the following three classes:

- Pattern Class: A pattern object is a compiled representation of a regular expression. The Pattern class provides
  no public constructors.
